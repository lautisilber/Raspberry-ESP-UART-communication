# Raspberry-ESP UART communication

Communication between a Raspberry pi (or any python capable, UART enabled device) and a esp8266 (almost exactly the same for esp32)

Just connect the UART bus, load the firmware to the esp with your wifi credentials and run the python script 'communicate.py'. You can send and receive data from the reaspberry through that script and send and receive data from the esp8266 by entering to it's ip address on oyur browser
